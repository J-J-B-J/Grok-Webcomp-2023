<h1>The Importance of Being Earnest: An Excerpt</h1>

<p>
    <strong>Algernon.</strong> When I am in trouble, eating is the only thing that consoles me. Indeed, when I am in really great trouble, as any one who knows me intimately will tell you, I refuse everything except food and drink. At the present moment I am eating muffins because I am unhappy. Besides, I am particularly fond of muffins. <span>[Rising.]</span>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Jack.</strong> <span>[Rising.]</span> Well, that is no reason why you should eat them all in that greedy way. <span>[Takes muffins from Algernon.]</span>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Algernon.</strong> <span>[Offering tea-cake.]</span> I wish you would have tea-cake instead. I don't like tea-cake.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Jack.</strong> Good heavens! I suppose a man may eat his own muffins in his own garden.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Algernon.</strong> But you have just said it was perfectly heartless to eat muffins.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Jack.</strong> I said it was perfectly heartless of you, under the circumstances. That is a very different thing.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Algernon.</strong> That may be. But the muffins are the same. <span>[He seizes the muffin-dish from Jack.]</span>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Jack.</strong> Algy, I wish to goodness you would go.
